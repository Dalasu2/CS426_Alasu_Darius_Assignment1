# CS426_Assignment1 | Soccer Game
A small soccer game that follows the "What Home Means to Me" theme. This project was created for Assignment 1 in CS 426.
___
## ➤ Overview
This project follows the theme "What Home Means to Me" by creating an indoor soccer court. Not only my interest for soccer expressed through the setting, but the main character is dressed in a Romania soccer kit, continuing the soccer theme while also giving a small hint to my family's nationality. All of the requirements are met, and the majority of models were created/edited using blender.
